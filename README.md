# Simple Score

A very subjective approach to providing a Simple Living score to a residential address.

Using the WalkScore API, Google Maps API, React, and axios to pull data.

Once data is retrieved for a certain address, there is an internal calculation to give the address a "Simple Score". This is based on the walk score, bike score, proximity to cafes, proximity to a public library, etc. It is an attempt to provide an overall view on a location, and can be used when purchasing a home for example.
